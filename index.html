        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio website ! I'm passionate about web
          development...
        </p>
        <p>
          Hello there! I'm John Doe, a passionate and creative web developer
          based in the digital realm. With a strong curiosity for all things
          tech, I've embarked on an exciting journey to craft elegant and
          user-friendly web experiences that push the boundaries of what's
          possible on the internet.

        <p style="margin-top: 20px">
          Ever since I wrote my first lines of code, I've been fascinated by the
          power of technology to shape our world. Over the years, I've honed my
          skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, transforming static web pages
          into dynamic and interactive wonders that captivate users and leave a
          lasting impression.

          <h2>Tribute Page</h2>
          <p>
            The tribute page project is a project where users can pay homage to
            individuals who have made significant contributions to various
            fields. I created personalized webpages dedicated to these
            individuals, highlighting their achievements and impact. Through
            this project,I gain hands-on experience in HTML and CSS, honing my
            web development skills. By constructing a visually appealing and
            informative tribute page, I showcased my ability to structure
            content, apply styling, and effectively communicate my subject's
            importance. The tribute page project serves as a valuable stepping
            stone in the journey of becoming proficient web developer while
            celebrating the legacies of inspiring figures.
